Data scientist operate more and more in a world that goes beyond their locale “island” of RStudio or Jupyter notebooks. There is a growing need to integrate trained models into a production environment. This results in the code starting a life outside a notebook, where it will be maintained and changed by other data scientist.  

In this transition, the code is getting new requirements. With an initial goal to create the most accurate machine learning model, we now see that in most cases the code can’t be easily integrated in a production environment or can’t be maintained by others. Data- or DevOps-engineers are supporting in these cases, but these disciplines don’t always speak the same language and might have a different approach on how software needs to be developed.  

In this hands-on workshop specially created for data scientists we will show you the world of clean coding and discuss problems we have seen with moving machine learning models into production. We will be doing so by showing you a series of short refactoring kata’s, always starting with a theoretical part. As a result of this workshop, the transition from local data science code to a solid production product will be easier and will result in gaining business value faster.
